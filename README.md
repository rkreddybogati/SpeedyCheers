    <p>
      For a totally not-fake-at-all reason, a Technical Product Manager (TPM) brings to you the proposal to build a product called “SpeedyCheers”.
      Speedy Cheers is an Uber equivalent, except that rather than getting a ride, by “Requesting a Cheer” a SpeedyCheer driver will come to your location, and “cheer you on” on whatever task you are doing. If you are telling a joke, they’ll come to laugh. If you are lifting weights, they’ll pump you up. If giving a speech, they’ll clap louder than anyone else. You feel great, they feel great (cause they get paid); it’s a win-win!
    </p>  
    
    <h4> The TPM gives you these requirements: </h4>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>When requesting a cheer, the closest SpeedyCheer driver will be notified of your location.</li>
        <li>SpeedyCheers will be paid in 5-minute increments charging $10/5 minute.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      Please share your proposal for how you’d architect and implement SpeedyCheers. For your reference, at Galvanize we heavily use AWS and primarily implement it in a Serverless fashion. While your proposal does not need to be with AWS or Serverless, it is definitely an asset if you can comfortably incorporate it into your diagram.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Please make sure to:</h4>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Share an overall diagram of how SpeedyCheers will work. We recommend having a user icon on the diagram and showing how the user’s request flows through the different components of your architecture.
          You are welcome to use https://www.draw.io or any other tool you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain your architecture in plain English. As great as your diagram maybe, it’ll require some level of explanation for us to understand what you were thinking about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain your choices behind your technology and programming language selection and why it is a great fit for the product you are building.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      You can write as much as you like, as long as it is clear We do not want to limit your creativity; but definitely more is not always better, it all depends on what you are elaborating on.
